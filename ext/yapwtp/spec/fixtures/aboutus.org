<big>'''AboutUs''' is a [[WikiWiki|wiki]] for and about businesses, organizations, blogs, forums, and really anything or anyone that has a website.

''Think of us as the guide to [[DomainPage|websites]] (that you can also help build).''</big>

'''AboutUs''' aims to provide you with both an introduction to sites in the areas you care about as well as a way to share your knowledge of those websites.

AboutUs [[DomainPage|domain pages]] include a [[summary]] of the website as well as more text about it, relevant [[tags]], its contact information, [[ImageHelp|photos or logos]], connections with [[RelatedDomains|related websites]] and more... all while linking directly to the website.{{PullQuote|right|AboutUs dynamically creates pages from publicly accessible information on Web sites, like meta tags and [[whois]] information. Once built, the pages - like any [[WikiWiki|wiki]] - are available to be edited by the company, users, or anyone who visits the site.|[[NYTimes.com|NY Times]] [http://www.nytimes.com/external/readwriteweb/2009/01/09/09readwriteweb-aboutus_wiki_five_million_series_a.html?dbk article about AboutUs.org]}}

As a [[WikiWiki|wiki]], information on AboutUs pages can be added to and changed by clicking the <big>'''[[edit]] pencil'''</big> button... ''and we encourage you to do so.''

'''Finding information''' - If you'd like to see what information we have on a given [[DomainPage|website]] or share your knowledge of it, simply search for the URL (like Example.com) at the top right.

'''Sharing your knowledge''' - AboutUs is what it is today thanks to the people who edit and improve it. Please feel free to help build this guide to websites by clicking one of the many edit pencil icons. [[Image:EditPencilSnapshot.png]]
