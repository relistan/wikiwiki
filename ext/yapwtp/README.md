YAPWTP
======

Yet Another Peg Wikitext Parser is a C implementation of a large
subset of MediaWiki's wikitext syntax.  It currently takes input on
stdin and presents output on stdout, though that is likely to be
optional behavior in the future.  The major advantages of this
implementation are intended to be speed and memory footprint.
